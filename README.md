#Shop App
This is my first flutter app.
A Simple Flutter based Shop App that can run on both android and ios. It uses firebase as backend.
It has all basic navigation feature with decent effects and animation.

Feel free to work on it and create PRs.

Run "flutter pub get" without quotes to get all th dependecies to work.

Drop a star if you like it.
